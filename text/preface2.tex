\chapter*{Preface to the First Reprinting}\label{PREFACE2}


Well, what a year it's been! Interest in \textit{Learn Prolog Now!}
continues to grow. College Publications brought out the first
paperback edition in June 2006, and since then the number of hits on
the website (\url{www.learnprolognow.org}) has increased steadily. The
most dramatic month was May 2007 when we had 6,322 unique visitors; a reader
submitted the LPN! link to Reddit (\url{http://programming.reddit.com})
and for a heady moment we felt a bit like Smosh!

We've also been pleased by the emails we continue to get from students
and instructors using the material. Some point out typos, others tell
us of their experiences in teaching or learning with the book, and
a pleasing number simply want to say ``Thank you!''.  All in all, it
was fast becoming clear that it was about time for a first (corrected)
reprinting.

But what really made us get down to work was the sudden appearance of
a French translation. H\'{e}l\`{e}ne Manu\'{e}lian, who began
translating LPN! shortly after its appearance in paperback, finished
earlier than anticipated --- so suddenly we had \textit{Prolog Tout de
Suite !}  on our hands too! This inspired us all to get down to the
task of correcting and improving the English version.

So, here it is again, all squeaky clean. Once again, if you like the
website, we hope you like the (new!) paperback even more. And, as
usual, we wish you every success in your endeavours to Learn Prolog
Now!

\subsection*{Acknowledgments}

Once again we're in debt to many people: everyone who gave us feedback
on the first printing and the website, and (as ever) to the
indefatigable Jane Spurr. However this time we owe a particularly deep
debt to S\'{e}bastien Hinderer, Eric Kow, Matthieu Quignard,
and (of course) H\'{e}l\`{e}ne Manu\'{e}lian. Their work on
\textit{Prolog Tout de Suite !}, not only created a beautiful
translation, it also helped us with the present volume. Warmest thanks
to all.
